                    <p align="justify"> ERPsim is a global business simulation competition where teams utilize SAP ERP software to manage a virtual
                    company. The competition promotes practical experience in enterprise resource planning and supply chain
                    management, while fostering teamwork and problem-solving skills. At the 11th Annual ERPsim competition held at
                    Central Michigan University, approximately 40 teams participated with our team earning the 4th position. My role
                    in the competition was focused on ensuring product availability and inventory management, however, I also
                    excelled in other roles such as sales manager and analyst.
